// Default model mapping — capability roles to inference profile IDs.
// Overridden at runtime via resolveModels() using app settings.
//
// ROLES:
//   creator   — The most capable model. Handles writing, quality evaluation, and
//               any task where output quality is the top priority. Assign your best
//               (and typically most expensive) model here. Used by: Writer, Quality Gates.
//
//   worker    — Reliable mid-tier model for bulk tasks that need competence but not
//               peak creativity. Research, planning, editing, and analysis. A good
//               balance of cost and capability. Used by: Researcher, Planner, Editor.
//
//   formatter — Mechanical output formatting (DOCX, PPTX generation). The task is
//               mostly code execution with minimal reasoning, so the cheapest capable
//               model is fine. Used by: Formatter agents.
//
//   vision    — Multimodal model for video/image analysis. Must support video content
//               blocks in the Converse API. Used by: Demo Analyst when video is attached.
