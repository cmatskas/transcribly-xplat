# Release Notes

## v2.7.1

### UI Improvements
- **Compact file attachment chips** — Replaced card-based file lists with inline pill/chip UI across Chat, Work, and Swarm tabs. Files now render as small 26px chips inside the input card with truncated names, reducing vertical space by ~75%.
- **Attach button badge** — The `+` attach button now shows a count badge when files are attached for at-a-glance awareness.

### Bug Fixes
- **Notification errors** — Fixed notification-related errors in main process.

## v2.7.0

### Logging Overhaul
- **Replaced custom logger with `electron-log`** — Zero-dependency, 95KB library with auto-rotation, standard log levels, and native `electron-updater` compatibility. Fixes `this._logger.info is not a function` crash.
- **Structured logging across all backend models** — 27 log statements with consistent prefixes (`[swarm:id]`, `[work:id]`, `[browser]`, `[code-interpreter]`, `[skills]`, `[memory]`) for easy filtering.
- **Swarm pipeline observability** — Pipeline start/complete, agent handoffs, quality gate decisions (PASS/REVISE/FAIL with scores), and agent errors now logged.
- **Session lifecycle tracking** — Code Interpreter and Browser session start/stop events logged with session IDs.
- **Tool execution errors** — Work tab tool failures logged with session context.
- **Skills init summary** — Skill count and load failures logged at startup.
- Logs written to `~/Library/Logs/Transcribely/main.log` (macOS) / `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Transcribely\logs\main.log` (Windows).

### Bug Fixes
- **Missing peer dependencies** — Added `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` and `@popperjs/core` as explicit dependencies. Fixes `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` crash on launch and Bootstrap tooltip rendering in Settings.

## v2.6.0

### Video Analysis & Storyboard Assets
- **Nova Premier video analysis** — Demo Analyst agent sends video to `us.amazon.nova-premier-v1:0` via Converse API for multimodal analysis. Videos ≤25MB sent as bytes, >25MB uploaded to S3.
- **Keyframe extraction** — OpenCV extracts 1 frame per 2 seconds (max 60) in the sandbox. Frame manifest with paths and timestamps flows through the pipeline.
- **Frame-embedded storyboard decks** — Scene Writer references specific frames, Formatter embeds actual screenshots in PPTX slides via `add_picture()`.

### System Notifications
- Native OS notifications (macOS Notification Center / Windows toast) for: review pause, input request, pipeline complete, pipeline error.
- Clicking a notification brings Transcribely to focus.

### Work Tab Reliability
- **Per-conversation sandbox persistence** — Sandbox lives across all messages in the same conversation. Files from message 1 are available in message 5. No more re-uploading.
- **Per-conversation file isolation** — Attached files stored per-session. Switching conversations swaps file state. No cross-conversation bleed.
- **Document generation reliability** — System prompt requires skill activation before doc creation, retries on code errors, single code call for documents. Sandbox timeout increased to 2 hours.
- **Tilde expansion** — `~/Documents/Transcribely/file.docx` now resolves correctly in `save_file_locally`.

### Swarm Tools Audit (6 fixes)
- **File uploads fixed** — `uploadFile()` (nonexistent) replaced with proven base64+executeCode pattern. File attachments now actually reach the sandbox.
- **`save_file_locally` fixed** — Was calling nonexistent `downloadFile()`. Now uses `readFileBase64` + Buffer. Added path security checks and Windows double-path fix.
- **`generate_image` wired** — SageMaker SDXL primary, Nova Canvas fallback. Images saved to sandbox for document embedding.
- **`list_directory` added** — Agents can browse local directories.
- **Formatter verification** — `_verifyLocalSave()` checks if the file actually exists on disk after formatter agents run.

### Skill Updates
- **docx**: Line numbers, header with document title, footer with "Amazon Confidential" + page number. Must pip install first, single code call, never describe.
- **pptx**: Must pip install first, single code call, never describe.

### Bug Fixes
- IPC file dialog for swarm attachments — fixes empty `File.path` with `contextIsolation: true`
- `@opentelemetry/api` added as direct dependency — fixes Windows launch crash (was peer dep of Strands SDK, missing from asar)
- Sandbox not torn down for conversations with agents mid-task
- `sessionStarted` now tracks sessions started for file extraction (cleanup leak fix)

## v2.5.0

### Swarm — Multi-Agent Content Pipelines
- **4 pipeline templates**: Article/Blog Post, Keynote/Presentation, Speech/Talk, Demo/Storyboard
- **Sequential agent execution** with Strands SDK: research → plan → quality gate → write → edit → quality gate → format
- **Per-agent model selection** via capability roles (creator/worker/formatter)
- **Checkpoint persistence** to disk — pipeline state survives interruptions
- **Autonomy modes**: Supervised (review at checkpoints), Guided (review + auto-resolve low-risk), Autonomous (fully hands-off)
- **Tool integration**: web browsing, code execution, file I/O via AgentCore Browser and Code Interpreter

### Quality Rubric System
- **Rubric-based quality gates** replacing free-text PASS/REVISE with structured JSON evaluation
- **Weighted binary criteria** with penalty support (negative weights subtract when triggered)
- **Per-template rubrics**: 12-15 criteria each covering scope, fidelity, authenticity, and craft
- **Three-tier decisions**: PASS (≥0.75), REVISE (with targeted feedback), FAIL (below floor)
- **CANNOT_ASSESS/SKIP** for criteria that don't apply to a specific brief
- **Rubric score card UI** — visual pass/fail breakdown in quality gate output cards
- **Brief-specific rubric adaptation** — one LLM call specializes generic criteria to the specific brief
- **Historical feedback injection** — past failure patterns injected into writer/editor prompts
- **Competitor reference penalty** (-3 weight) across all templates

### AWS Content Guidelines
- Embedded in `research-first`, `copy-editing`, and `copywriting` skills
- Prioritize AWS/Amazon customer references from public sources
- Sweep 9 (Reference & Attribution Audit) in copy-editing
- Placeholder format for missing references: `[CUSTOMER REFERENCE NEEDED: description]`
